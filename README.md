Data augmentation and transfer learning are vital for leveraging machine learning on small datasets. These techniques mitigate overfitting and improve model generalizability by artificially expanding the dataset and leveraging pre-existing knowledge, respectively. 

In this exploration, we'll delve into the application of these and similar methodologies for image classification and tabular regression problems on small datasets, presenting practical insights and challenges encountered in implementing these techniques.
